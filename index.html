<h1> When I was 7 years old...</h1>
<h2> Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey.</h2>
<h2> I was devastated. What was I going to do? I couldn't ride my bike, play outside, or meet my friends. But, I forgot the most important thing I'd miss out on - the internet.</h2>
<h2> I debated if I should ask my parents to figure out a way to get a generator. That'd be the answer to all my problems! However, this was the first time in my life that the internet was taken away from me, and I decided it'd be better to experience it as it is. I felt like a caveman for the next 5 days. I spent my time with my parents and a litted candle, playing boardgames or eating snacks that can't go bad. It was long and boring, and I felt like I was going through a dopamine detox. </h2>
<h2> Soon enough, the power finally came on again. Although I was happy, it made me reflect as well on how much of my life, even at that age, was consumed by the internet.</h2>
<h2> From then on, I never took the internet for granted. :]</h2>
